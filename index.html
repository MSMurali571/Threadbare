<h2><b>Drop Shipping</b></h2>
<p><b>Drop shipping</b> is a form of retail business in which the seller accepts customer orders without keeping stock on hand. Instead, in a form of supply chain management, the seller transfers the orders and their shipment details either to the manufacturer, a wholesaler, another retailer, or a fulfillment house, which then ships the goods directly to the customer.

The seller is responsible for marketing and selling the product, but has limited control over product quality, storage, inventory management, or shipping.</p>
